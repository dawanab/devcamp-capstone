## Dawana's Bistro (Bottega Capstone Project)

This web application is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The landing page begins in the `pages/index.js` file.
API routes can be found in `pages/api` directory (Stripe). The directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## New Technologies Used for Capstone

- Sanity: it's a CMS that's built with React. It's used to maintain the products on the landing page
of the web application. It also holds the data that's displayed when a user selects a product and 
views it in the cart.

- Stripe API: it allows users to accept payments and send payouts globally. By using the Stripe 
API, it's possible to embed custom user experiences directly in the Stripe Dashboard.

- Next.js: it's a React framework that accelerates the process for building web applications. It's
efficient in handling routing, data fetching, and integrations.

## Deployment

The eCommerce application was deployed on [Heroku](https://dawanas-bistro.herokuapp.com/).
